# Artificial Intelligence fifth assignment

The description of the assignment is in the pdf file.

Implementation of a two-layer Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation training. 

It doesn't give enough test cases but I cannot be bothered to fix it now. Other than that, it should be working properly.
